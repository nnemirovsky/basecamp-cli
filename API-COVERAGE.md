# Basecamp CLI API Coverage Matrix

Coverage of Basecamp 3 API endpoints. Source: [bc3-api/sections](https://github.com/basecamp/bc3-api).

## Summary

| Status | Sections | Endpoints |
|--------|----------|-----------|
| ✅ Implemented | 42 | 155 |
| ⏭️ Out of scope | 4 | 12 |
| **Total (docs)** | **46** | **167** |

**100% coverage of in-scope API** (155/155 endpoints)

Out-of-scope sections are excluded from parity totals and scripts: chatbots (different auth), legacy Clientside (deprecated)

> Note: the per-row `Endpoints` column in the Coverage by Section table sums higher than the Summary totals above. The discrepancy predates the BC5 baseline; the row count (46 sections) is authoritative for the `Since` column. Reconciling endpoint counts is pre-existing maintenance, tracked separately.

**SDK version:** v0.7.3 + pending UpdateCampfireLine (basecamp/basecamp-sdk#295). On merge of the SDK PR + next tagged release, this header will move to that version and the temporary fork pin in `go.mod` will be dropped.

## Coverage by Section

The **Since** column tags each row with the Basecamp version that introduced its section: `BC4` for sections that shipped before Basecamp 5, `BC5` for sections introduced in Basecamp 5. If a BC5 release adds endpoints to an existing BC4 section, split them into a new row tagged `BC5` rather than bumping the BC4 row's `Endpoints` count — that keeps the column unambiguous per row. Column dropped post-BC4 decommission.

## Priority Guide

- **high**: Core workflow, frequently needed
- **medium**: Useful but not critical path
- **low**: Specialized, rarely needed
- **skip**: Out of scope (client portal, chatbots, internal)

## Remaining (Intentionally Skipped)

All remaining sections are intentionally out of scope:
- **chatbots** (10 endpoints) - Requires chatbot key auth, not OAuth
- **client_approvals/correspondences/replies** (18 endpoints) - Legacy Clientside portal
These are excluded from doc parity totals.

## Skipped Sections

### Client Portal (`client_approvals`, `client_correspondences`, `client_replies`) - Legacy "Clientside"

These endpoints are for the **legacy "Clientside"** feature (the dedicated client portal area), which is distinct from the modern "clients as project participants" model.

**Why skipped:**
- Confusingly similar naming to modern client setup
- Legacy feature with limited adoption
- Requires projects with specific client portal configuration
- Unlikely to be needed in typical developer/agent workflows

**Note:** The `client_visibility` endpoint IS implemented (via `basecamp recordings visibility`) because it's part of the **modern** clients setup for controlling what client participants can see on any recording.

### Chatbots

The chatbots API uses a **chatbot key** for authentication rather than OAuth tokens. This is a fundamentally different auth model:
- Chatbot keys are per-integration, not per-user
- They're designed for automated integrations (Slack bots, etc.)
- The CLI uses OAuth for user-scoped access

Supporting chatbot auth would require a separate configuration path. If chatbot functionality is needed, a dedicated chatbot-specific tool would be more appropriate.

## Implementation Notes

### Endpoint Patterns

Each resource typically supports:
- `GET /...` - List
- `GET /.../:id` - Show
- `POST /...` - Create
- `PUT /.../:id` - Update
- `DELETE /.../:id` - Trash (soft delete)

Plus action endpoints:
- `POST /.../:id/completion` - Complete (todos)
- `DELETE /.../:id/completion` - Uncomplete (todos)
- `PUT /.../:id/position` - Reorder
- `POST /.../:id/pin` - Pin to top
- `DELETE /.../:id/pin` - Unpin
- `PUT /.../:id/status/:status` - Change status (trash/archive/restore)

### CLI Command Patterns

```bash
basecamp <resource>                    # List (default)
basecamp <resource> list               # List (explicit)
basecamp <resource> show <id>          # Show details
basecamp <resource> <id>               # Show (shorthand)
basecamp <resource> create "..."       # Create new
basecamp <resource> update <id>        # Update existing
basecamp <singular> "..."              # Create (shorthand)
```

## Verification

API coverage is manually tracked in this document. The coverage matrix above is updated when new endpoints are implemented.

To verify a specific endpoint is implemented, check the corresponding command in `internal/commands/`.
